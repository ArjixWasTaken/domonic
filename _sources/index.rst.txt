HTML TEMPLATING
---------------

.. code-block :: python

  from domonic.html import *

  mydom = html(body(h1('Hello, World!')))
  print(f"{mydom}")

.. code-block :: html

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <body>
          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      </body>
  </html>


To pretty print use an f-string. Which also adds the doctype.


install
----------------
.. code-block :: python

  python3 -m pip install domonic


or if you had it before upgrade:

.. code-block :: python

  python3 -m pip install domonic --upgrade

There's a few args you can pass to domonic on the command line to help you out.

To launch the docs for a quick reference to the APIs use:

.. code-block :: python

  python3 -m domonic -h


This command will attempt to generate a template from a webpage. (only simple pages for now)

.. code-block :: python

  python3 -m domonic -d http://eventual.technology


Then you can edit/tweak it to get what you need and build new components quicker.


INSTALLING - (linux/mac only)

If you like you can install domonic to your .bashprofile

.. code-block :: python

  python3 -m domonic --install

Now in your terminal whenever you want to start a new project you can type...

.. code-block :: python

  project mycoolproject

and it will smash out a basic project for you.

you can also now access the docs quickly simply by typing...

.. code-block :: python

  domonic -h

Finally, you can open and edit .bashprofile to tweak it to your own preferences.

EXAMPLE PROJECT

A cron viewer:

Disclaimer
----------------
There's several more widely supported libraries doing HTML generation, DOM reading/manipulation, terminal wrappers etc. Maybe use one of those for production due to strictness and support.

This is becoming more of a fast prototyping library.
